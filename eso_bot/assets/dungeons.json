          "This boss is so much fun but can get incredibly chaotic if people do not pay attention. This fight is all about the tank controlling the boss. If the tank looses control of this boss it is all out mayhem and very hard to get damage on the boss let alone survive his enrage mechanics. This can be really simple or really difficult."

When he charges he will go in a straight line aiming in the direction he is FACING at the time. So get your tank to position their back into a corner so that he runs straight at the wall. Every time he has finished charging move to another corner close by and repeat the process.",
          "**Burst** – After the charge ability he will stamp the ground and creat a fast growing large BURTS aoe. This can be blocked or dodge rolled and is very easy to spot. The damage is not so bad at this stage but you need to avoid it none the less. for dps, simply dodge roll out and then get back in when it is gone.",
          "**Enraged** – At low health the boss will buff himself with FIRE! His charge ability now emits a massive fire trail wherever he ran from and to, so do NOT stand in this. Also his burst ability now has an added fire damage burst to it. You can still block and dodge the initial damage BUT the second tick of damage will still hit you and you will be knocked over regardless."

The wind up to this heavy attack can actually hit JUST before the attack connects so be sure to look out for this and block early. If you fail to block it is a guaranteed one shot!"

It will connect with the target before the visual for the swing actually happens so keep your eyes peeled and block as soon as you see this. This should always be on the tank but if something goes wrong the dps can survive it IF they block.",

The tank should take the boss to the center and your dps and healers should find their own space and gradually burn him down. Occasionally Athor will call down a rain of lightning. Just step away from it.",

          "**Fire Trail** – Occasionally Zaven will raise his hand aiming at whoever has agro. He will cast a straight line of flames across the ground. So if it is aiming at YOU, simply move to one side and let it pass. If this hits a dps or a healer, it is pretty much a one shot.",
          "**The wheel** – Spokes of flames will fire from the bosses feet. These are low damage, avoidable and not too much of a problem. Just keep your eyes peeled and either avoid them or have a heal to hand."
